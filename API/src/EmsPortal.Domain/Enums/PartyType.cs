/// AN EXPLICIT COLUMN, not "does CorporateName happen to be filled in". Two things need this answer and
/// neither can afford to guess: the client picker, which must offer only individuals when the request is
/// for an individual, and <see cref="Entities.Person.ClientDisplayName"/>, which reads a person surname-
/// first and an organisation as its plain legal name. Deriving it from a nullable field means a row with
/// a blank name has no type at all, and a row somebody half-filled has the wrong one.
/// </para>

/// It is deliberately NOT an option set. A tenant may rename a status or add a department because those
