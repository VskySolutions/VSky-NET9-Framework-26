/// The transactional email allowlist (WO-124, AC-ETPL-005.5). Only account-security templates (and the

/// only. Enforced centrally by the email dispatch pipeline so no caller can send email for a

/// <para>
/// EVERY ACCOUNT-SECURITY KEY BELONGS HERE. The gate drops a non-allowlisted send with nothing but a
/// warning log, and the endpoints behind these keys deliberately answer the same either way — the
/// forgot-password flow returns its neutral "if that address exists we have emailed it" whether or not
/// anything was sent. So a key missing from this list is invisible from the outside: it does not fail,
/// it just never arrives. <see cref="EmailTemplateKey.PasswordResetLink"/> was missing and locked users
/// out of self-service reset entirely.
