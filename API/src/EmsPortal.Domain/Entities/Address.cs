    // record of their own because "where do we send the invoice, and who is it addressed to?" is one
    // question with one answer, and splitting it across two records is how a client ends up with a
    // billing address and nobody to send it to — or with three billing addresses and three billing
    // contacts and nothing saying which belongs to which.
    //
    // Every one of them is optional, on every address. Most addresses in the platform are a place and
    // nothing more (a person's home, an office), and the field-set only asks for these where a form
    // opts in — see AppAddressFields' `contact`, which today only the client intake's billing
    // addresses set.
